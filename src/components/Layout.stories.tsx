import React from 'react'
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom'

import Layout from './Layout'

export default { title: 'Layout' }

export const withChildren = () => (
  <Layout title='Storybook'>
    <div>
      <p>I represent the children.</p>
      <p>
        Because Layout contains Next.js Links, you will find an error in the console due to the rest of Next.js being
        rendered higher in the tree. I do not think it is important enough to find a workaround at this point. So,
        remove this Layout story once real stories for isolated components have been created.
      </p>
    </div>
  </Layout>
)
